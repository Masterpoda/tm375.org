# History

[Toastmasters](http://toastmasters.org/) is a public speaking and leadership organization. There are local chapters (also called clubs) all over the world. This repo is focused on a specific club ([#375](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/00000375-fort-collins-375-toastmasters-club)) which meets in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. As it was founded in 1946, there are few clubs which are older and still holding meetings today.
